# Comcast Telecommunication Customer Complaints Analysis

Hi, I’m **Harshita**, and this is my project for the **Pregrad Business Analyst Course**. This project focuses on analyzing customer complaints against Comcast to identify trends, major complaint types, and resolution effectiveness.

## 📌 Project Overview

Comcast, a global telecommunications company, has been facing continuous customer service issues. This project analyzes a dataset containing customer complaints to uncover key insights about complaint frequency, resolution trends, and state-wise complaint status.

   - Created monthly and daily trend charts to visualize the number of complaints.

2. **Complaint Frequency Analysis**  
   - Identified the most common complaint types.

3. **Complaint Categorization**  
   - Determined whether complaints were mostly related to the internet, network issues, or other categories.

4. **Status Categorization**  
   - Created a new categorical variable:  
     - "Open" (includes Open & Pending complaints)  
     - "Closed" (includes Closed & Solved complaints)  

5. **State-wise Complaint Status**  
   - Generated a stacked bar chart to show complaint resolutions across different states.

6. **State-wise Complaint Analysis**
